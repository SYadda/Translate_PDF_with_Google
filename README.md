# Translate_PDF_with_Google
A python selenium crawler for batch PDF translation using Google.

This is a little program I wrote. Unfortunately, it has a problem: Google recognizes that the browser that requested the translation is "automatically controlled by software" and refuses to translate the document. The downloaded translation is exactly the same as the original document.

If anyone can help me solve this problem, I would be very grateful!
